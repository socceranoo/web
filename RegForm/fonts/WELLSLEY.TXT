The Wellsley font is a calligraphic font with curled serifs somewhat angular curves and a Gothic look to it.  This is a complete true type font for Windows containing the entire upper and lower case alphabet, numbers, punctuation, and most of the extended characters.

This font is (c) 1994 by J. Fordyce but may be freely distributed provided it is not altered, no fee is charged for it, and this text file is included with it.
