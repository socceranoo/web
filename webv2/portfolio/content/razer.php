		<h4>Motivation:</h4>
		<p>I had a bunch of my songs in my hard disk which i had collected over the years and i wanted to listen to it whenever i liked. It was too difficult to carry the hard disk around every time i travelled. So decided to hook up my hard disk with the website to listen to my songs on the go. </p>

		<h4>Table details : (MySQL)</h4>
		<ul class="proj-ul">
			<li><p><b>A song table </b>: This table contains information about the song, artist, album and the path to the song on the computer. This table is updated whenever a playlist is updated with certain songs (I thought it will be an overkill to add all the songs to the table in one shot).</p></li>
			<li><p><b>A playlist table </b>: Stores the playlists created by all users, user who created them and the playlist id.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>A song-playlist-map table </b>: this table to store the mapping information between the song id and the playlist id.</p></li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Features:</h4>
		<ul class="proj-ul">
			<li><p><b>Search while you play </b>: You can dynamically search while the song is playing (It is an excellent feature that grooveshark has and youtube doesnâ€™t).</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Integrated with HTML5 audio</b>: This enables listening songs on my iPhone and iPad without any App.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Integration with jPlayer </b>: used <audio> element at first and then switched to jPlayer for aesthetic reasons. The jPlayer really looked cool and had operations to add, edit current playlists which minimized my work of maintaining it myself.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Playlist functions </b>: Allows to search songs and add to playlists. Also can create playlists.</p></li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Nice to haves ( Working on it):</h4>
		<ul class="proj-ul">
			<li><p><b>Expand database </b>: Since the song database is limited to my collection alone, does not scale well if i want to expand the database. So planning it to integrate with grooveshark and spotify widgets to make it a one stop solution for any song using their public APIs.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Improve search </b>: Improve my search on the back end (Php) in my hard disk mounted on ubuntu virtual machine. Just implemented a brute force file name search currently which can take a while to complete for generic searches.</p></li>
			<li><p><b>Modify playlists </b>: Modifying the existing playlists as to remove or add songs.</p></li>
